This repository contains the code for a browser-based implementation of the classic game Battleship, as presented in the book Head First JavaScript. The game is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To play the game, you will need to download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from this repository and save them to your local machine. You can do this by clicking the green "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP", or by cloning the repository using Git.

Simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The game will load in the browser window, and you can begin playing by following the on-screen instructions. To play the game, you will  need to enter the coordinates of each shot manually in the form provided. Once you have entered the coordinates, click the "Fire!" button or press the return key to reveal whether you hit or missed the computer's ships.

If you would like to customize the game, you can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to suit your needs. You can change the layout and appearance of the game by modifying the CSS, and you can change the game logic and functionality by modifying the JavaScript.

Credits: this implementation of Battleship was inspired by the book Head First JavaScript, by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson.
